# Different API versions

The main idea with these API versions is to show you different kinds of implementation for making pagination API.
You will see different patterns if you want you can read this post [Different approaches to do pagination in an API Rest](https://goscrapy.com.ar/post/different-approaches-to-do-pagination-in-an-api-rest/) where I explain with more details the different ways of pagination patterns.


Offset and Limit Pagination


Cursor-Based Pagination


Page-Based Pagination


Link Header Pagination


Time-Based Pagination


In the end, you can remember this, you could make a `Combination of Techniques`, always, more importantly, solve the problem in the best way and not follow a pattern strictly.
